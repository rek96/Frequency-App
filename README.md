# React app with Netlify Function API Fetch

Version 1 on my first React project.

Had a lot of troubles getting my react app to fetch data from an external API. Many solutions was tried, and i've ended up learning about Netlify Functions to handle basic external api requests.

There is still alot for me to learn, but this is a project i wanted to do for a while.
